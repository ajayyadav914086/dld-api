                    Rs. 10,000/&shy;. However, in his deposition, the appellant&shy;accused is named in the same breath
                    along with other accused persons and their family members. Apart from this witness, Shyam Sunder Sah
                    (P.W.7), Munna Sah (P.W.8) and Champa Devi (P.W.9) depose that the deceased was being troubled at
                    her matrimonial home, without particularly naming the appellantaccused, Nimay Sah.

                    style="color:#00000a">It ought to be noted that apart from these vague allegations, no specific
                    instance of hostile attitude or persistent demands of dowry have been pointed out by any of these
                    witnesses. Further, Shyam Sunder Sah (P.W.7), brother of the deceased, has admitted in his
                    cross&shy;examination that the deceased used to write him letters from her matrimonial place, and
                    that, none of the letters mention any harassment on account of demand of dowry.

                    style="color:#00000a">All other independent witnesses have turned hostile and have not supported the
                    prosecution story. In fact, even Panchanan Sah (P.W.2) who is the paternal uncle of the deceased and
                    a witness named in the FIR, has not supported the prosecution story. </span></span></span></li>

                    style="color:#00000a">Thus, on consideration of the oral testimonies of the witnesses, the
                    ingredients of Section 498&shy;A IPC have not been proved against the appellant&shy;accused by the
                    prosecution at the standard of beyond reasonable doubt. In such circumstances, there is nothing on
                    record to convict the appellant&shy;accused for the charge under Section 498&shy;A IPC.

                    style="color:#00000a">In light of the above, we are of the view that the conviction of the
                    appellant&shy;accused cannot be sustained. Accordingly, the judgment and order dated 11.02.2010,
                    passed by the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi in Criminal Appeal (S.J.) No. 176 of 2001 is hereby
                    set aside and the appellant&shy;accused is acquitted of the charges levelled against him. By order
                    dated 17.09.2010, this Court had enlarged the appellant&shy;accused on bail. His bail bonds stand
                    discharged.</span></span></span></li>
